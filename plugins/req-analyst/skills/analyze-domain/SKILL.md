Run a focused domain & competitive analysis on item #$ARGUMENTS. Output is enrichment for the team — not a gating verdict.

## Steps

1. Detect the platform from `git remote get-url origin`.

2. Fetch the item content:
   - **GitHub:** Use `gh issue view ${ISSUE_NUMBER} --json title,body,labels,comments`.
   - **Azure DevOps:** Use `curl` to fetch the work item — see `providers/azure-devops.md`.

3. Scan the repo for relevant documentation:
   - Look for `README.md`, `docs/**/*.md`, `requirements/**/*`, `specs/**/*`, `adr/**/*`, `rfcs/**/*`
   - Read files that reference key domain terms from the item
   - Build a short documentation summary for context

4. Use the **domain-analyst** agent, passing it the item title, body, inferred domain/category, **and** the documentation summary.

5. Output the domain & competitive analysis findings directly. Do not post to any platform — this is a local-only analysis.

If no argument is given, prompt the user for an item number.
